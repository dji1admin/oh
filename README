  To use the Report Generator:
1.  If the files are in a .zip archive, unzip it to your computer.
2.  Open file Rule606ReportGenerator.html in a browser.
3.  If you see a message
    "The browser mode you are running is not compatible with this application."
    Then please follow the suggestions in the rest of the message.
4.  Click on the button "Browse to the XSD File..."
5.  Browse to file oh-20191231.xsd in the "samples" folder and select it.
6.  Click on the button "Browse to the XML File..."
7.  Choose any one of the sample files, such as one of these three:
	606a1_held_order_public_report.xml
	606b1_held_exempt_not_held_customer_routing.xml
	606b3_not_held_customer_handling.xml
6.  After a few moments, your browser should produce one or more pdf files and
    offer to save or open them.  606b1 reports are limited to 500 rows each.
7.  Other sample .xml files vary the amount of data and period covered, to 
    illustrate the effect on the .pdf output.
8.  Any sample files you create on your own can also be loaded; so long as you
    have loaded the xsd file, it will report any syntax errors. 

If the application does not work at all inside your corporate IT environment,
it is most likely due to network or other security restrictions.  Please 
contact your IT department for assistance but do not attempt to circumvent 
their security measures without permission.

Suggestions directed to StructuredData@sec.gov regarding layout and content of
